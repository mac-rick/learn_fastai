Table 1-3. Deep learning vocabulary
Term Meaning
Label 			The data that we’re trying to predict, such as “dog” or “cat”
Architecture 		The template of the model that we’re trying to fit; i.e., the actual mathematical function that we’re passing
			the input data and parameters to
Model 			The combination of the architecture with a particular set of parameters
			Parameters The values in the model that change what task it can do and that are updated through model training
Fit 			Update the parameters of the model such that the predictions of the model using the input data match the
			target labels
Train 			A synonym for fit
Pretrained model	A model that has already been trained, generally using a large dataset, and will be fine-tuned
Fine-tune 		Update a pretrained model for a different task
Epoch 			One complete pass through the input data
Loss 			A measure of how good the model is, chosen to drive training via SGD
Metric 			A measurement of how good the model is using the validation set, chosen for human consumption
Validation set 		A set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is
Training set 		The data used for fitting the model; does not include any data from the validation set
Overfitting 		Training a model in such a way that it remembers specific features of the input data, rather than
			generalizing well to data not seen during training
CNN 			Convolutional neural network; a type of neural network that works particularly well for computer vision
